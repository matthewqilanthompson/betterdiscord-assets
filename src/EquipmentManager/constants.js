/**
 * EquipmentManager/constants — pure data plus three small lookups. No class,
 * no mixin, no side effects.
 *
 * SHAPE
 *   EQUIPMENT_DATABASE  flat object keyed by item id (107 entries). Each:
 *     { id, name, slot, rarity, icon, description, levelReq,
 *       stats: {...EMPTY_STATS, <overrides>}, specialEffects: [],
 *       setId: string|null, source, lore }
 *     EQUIPMENT_SLOTS has 10 keys, but an item's `slot` uses only 8 values:
 *     weapon, helmet, chestplate, gloves, boots, earring, necklace, and the
 *     special 'ring' (which fills either ring1 or ring2). No item uses offHand.
 *   EQUIPMENT_SETS      setId -> { name, pieces: [item ids], bonuses:
 *                       { pieceCount: statBlock } }
 *                       7 sets; six have 10 pieces, one has 3 — do not assume 10.
 *   Drop tables         DROP_CHANCE_BY_RANK, RARITY_POOL_BY_RANK,
 *                       RARITY_WEIGHTS_BY_RANK, RARITY_ORDER,
 *                       GUARANTEED_DROPS, GRANT_ONLY_SET_IDS
 *   Lookups             getEquipmentById (direct property access),
 *                       getEquipmentForSlot (linear filter — fine at n=107),
 *                       getRarityColor (falls back to E-grey)
 *
 * FAILURE MODES ARE SILENT — nothing here validates at load:
 *  - A DUPLICATE object key does not error. The last one wins and the earlier
 *    item vanishes with no warning.
 *  - A typo'd `setId` never matches a set, so that piece simply never counts
 *    toward a set bonus. No crash, just quietly missing content.
 *  - RARITY_ORDER deliberately omits 'E' (no E-tier items exist) and includes
 *    'SSS' as real-but-undroppable (reserved for grant-only Shadow Monarch
 *    Regalia). Reordering it affects drop-degradation logic that lives in
 *    Dungeons, NOT in this file.
 *
 * Integrity was verified programmatically (2026-08-03): 107 unique ids, no
 * dangling setId references, no invalid slots, and every EQUIPMENT_SETS.pieces
 * entry resolves to a real item. Re-run that check after bulk edits.

// 'E' is intentionally absent: no E-rarity equipment exists.
//
// 'Shadow Monarch' is the terminal tier and is NOT droppable — every item at
// that rarity is a Shadow Monarch's Regalia piece (see GRANT_ONLY_SET_IDS), and
// no entry in RARITY_POOL_BY_RANK references it, so the drop roll can never
// select it.
//
// ⚠️ CHANGED 2026-08-14: the Regalia previously carried rarity 'SSS', which left
// the game's strongest gear labelled BELOW farmable 'SSS+'/'NH'/'Monarch'/
// 'Monarch+' drops. Its power was always correct (a percentage multiplier applied
// by SoloLevelingStats — uncapped, scales with base stats, Shadow Monarch rank
// only), but the LABEL contradicted it. 'Shadow Monarch' is already a first-class
// rank in shared/rank-utils.js RANK_ORDER and carries a colour in ShadowExchange,
// ShadowSenses and ShadowArmy — EquipmentManager was the only module whose ladder
// stopped at 'Monarch+'. This aligns it.
//
// Safe because grant-only is enforced STRUCTURALLY by GRANT_ONLY_SET_IDS in the
// drop roll, not by which rarities appear in pools. 'SSS' is now unused by any
// item but is kept in the ladder so historical saves holding SSS gear still
// resolve a valid index.

// Each endgame rank still mostly yields the bottom of its own pool, but the
